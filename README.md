# Docker_service_PaaS_webPortal
ðŸ“Œ In this project I have to create a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS))<br>
ðŸ“Œ This app will help the user to run all the docker commands like: <br>
- docker images
- docker ps
- docker run
- docker rm -f
- docker exec etc...<Br>
